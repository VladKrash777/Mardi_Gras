						<p class="first">Mardi Gras Day
							The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras Day, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3
							and March 9 (depending on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).[
							In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and
							Claiborne and ending at Broad and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following
							the traditional Uptown route from Napoleon to St. Charles and then to Canal St.
							Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud horns, with entire
							families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous
							smaller parades and walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the
							Lyons Club, the Irish Channel Corner Club, Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all
							start early in the day Uptown and make their way to the French Quarter with at least one jazz band.
							At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne journeys from the Bywater through
							Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers rambles from
							bar to bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras
							Indians, divided into uptown and downtown tribes, parade in their finery.

						<p> <span> Costumes and masks</span>
							<hr> In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe
							members on the days before Fat Tuesday (other than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi
							Gras. Laws against concealing one's identity with a mask are suspended for the day. Banks are
							closed, and some businesses and other places with security concerns (such as convenience stores)
							post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.

						<p> <span>Traditional Colors</span><br>
							<hr>
							The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The
							colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
							inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is
							unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially
							selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.

							Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the
							three colors in that order symbolized justice, power, and faith. Errol Laborde, author of Marched
							the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory that the colors were based on
							heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to
							create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while
							white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted
							that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which
							states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and that colors
							cannot be placed on or next to other colors.The traditional colors are commonly addressed as
							purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though this order technically violates the rule of
							tincture

							<span>Throws</span><br>
							<hr>
							A 'throw' is the collective term used for the objects that are thrown from floats to parade-goers.
							Until the 1960s, the most common form was multi-colored strings of glass beads made in
							Czechoslovakia.

							Glass beads were supplanted by less expensive and more durable plastic beads, first from Hong Kong,
							then from Taiwan, and more recently from China. Lower-cost beads and toys allow float-riders to
							purchase greater quantities, and throws have become more numerous and common.

							In the 1990s, many people lost interest in small, cheap beads, often leaving them where they landed
							on the ground. Larger, more elaborate metallic beads and strands with figures of animals, people,
							or other objects have become the sought-after throws. David Redmond's 2005 film of cultural and
							economic globalization, Mardi Gras: Made in China, follows the production and distribution of beads
							from a small factory in Fuzhou, China to the streets of New Orleans during Carnival.

								excitement of Mardi Gras!</span><br>
							<hr>

							Mayor of New Orleans
							The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called
							Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.

							Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
							Carnival clubs, called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade
							goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!"

							The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social
							Aid & Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate
							costumes add to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all ages.

							New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to
							be at any time of the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their
							lifetime. Make your plans now to be a part of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say,
							"Laissez les bon temps rouler!"

							Sincerely,
							<br>
							<span id="laToyaSpan">LaToya Cantrell
								Mayor of New Orleans</span>
