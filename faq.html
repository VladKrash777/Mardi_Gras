						The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6,
						which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different
						day
						each year.
						Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
						Tuesday
						is always the day before Ash Wednesday.
						Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
						Wednesday.

						By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who
						grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every
						parade
						because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!)
						to
						hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.
						The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
						anyway).
						We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since parades can
						last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family
						area
						where you will see many families staking out their parade watching position, having picnics, playing
						ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about the streetcars, as
						they
						stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.
						You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie, which
						is
						only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras
						weekend,
						is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

						often kept secret until the parade. Their costumes, floats, some of their throws, and their "official"
						Mardi Gras poster (if they have one) reflect this theme. For example, after 9/11, patriotic themes
						were popular.
						Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some are
						named after the neighborhood where they parade.
